time slots logic
starts time ==> input
end time ==> input
time duration of each slots ==> constant as an input
number of slots ==> calculate in a way that it is a whole number
add the extra time into the last slot if any time remains after the division process

for morning shift
start time = 9 am
end time = 12 pm 
time duration for every slot = 10 min
start time - end time ==> 9 - 12 = 3 hrs X 60 = 180 min
number of slots = (start time - end time)/time duration for every slot = 180 min / 10 min = 18 slots
if number of slots is a whole number then = 18 slots
if for example there is a fraction number = then the remaining time must be added to the last slot
